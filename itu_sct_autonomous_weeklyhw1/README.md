- **Region Enumeration**: Classifies points into distinct regions based on the signs of their coordinates, with an additional `None` category for undefined regions.
- **Core Functions**:
  - Compute the distance of a point from the origin.
  - Calculate the distance between two points.
  - Compare the distances of two points from the origin.
  - Identify the region a point belongs to.
  - Determine if two points belong to the same region.
  - Display the coordinates of a point and its region.
